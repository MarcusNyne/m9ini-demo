[[Description]]
Demonstrate how properties can be inherited via section expansion.
Note the following:
  - Expanded sections are allowed to use replacement expressions in the section header; .base refers to the base section
  - In ColorList, Color1 comes from [Test] because [Test] overrides [Base]
  - In BaseColorList, Color1 comes from [Base] because the reference is from that level
  - In BaseColorList, Color3 is a "backwards reference"; An [E11] error is triggered in this case, but can be ignored (known issue)
  - In the output file, you get to see all inherited properties

[Test:Test_[=base.BaseId]] => [:dark_colors]
Color1=Red
Color3=Pink
ColorList=[=Color1],[=Color2],[=Color3]

[Base:dark_colors]
BaseId=33
Color1=Blue
Color2=Black
BaseColorList=[=Color1],[=Color2],[=Color3]

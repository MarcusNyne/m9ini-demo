[[Description]]
Demonstrate how properties can be inherited via section expansion.
Note the following:
- Expanded sections are allowed to use replacement expressions in the section header; .base refers to the base section
- In ColorList, Color1 comes from [Test] because [Test] overrides [Base]
- In BaseColorList, Color1 comes from [Base] because the reference is from that level
- In BaseColorList, Color3 is a "backwards reference"; An [E11] error is triggered in this case, but can be ignored (known issue)
- In the output file, you get to see all inherited properties

[Test:Test_33]
base=[Base:dark_colors]
Color1=Red
Color3=Pink
ColorList=Red,Black,Pink
BaseId=33
Color2=Black
BaseColorList=Blue,Black,Pink

[Base:dark_colors]
BaseId=33
Color1=Blue
Color2=Black
BaseColorList=Blue,Black,[=Color3]

[[WriteConfigLines_Failures]]
[E11] [Base:dark_colors].BaseColorList: Section property "Color3" not found in BaseColorList=[=Color1],[=Color2],[=Color3]

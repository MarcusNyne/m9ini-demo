[[Description]]
Demonstrates the use of parameters.  Parameters are external settings that are passed into the program that override configuration settings.
Note the following:
- This example passes in a list of parameters; another option would be to use uConfigParameters
- Animal is passed without a section specification.  Shape is passed with "Test" as the section specification.
- Animal is universally available in all sections
- Shape is only available in the "Test" section
- The Test description references "animal", which is passed in as a parameter, but is otherwise not available in the configuration file.
- The parameters, and their impact to configuration, can be seen in the output file.
